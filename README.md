# Endless

A single-page React application for fictitious company, Endless. The goal of this project was to build a landing page based off of the design comp provided. A REST API was used to retrieve steps for the "How It Works" section. The steps were then sorted by step number and correct information was extracted by comparing the dates of each version content object.
